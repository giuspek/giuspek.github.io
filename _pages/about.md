Welcome to my personal webpage! I'm an Italian researcher, I got my Ph.D. at University of Trento in 2025, and I am working on formal verification and automated reasoning, in particular AllSAT and AllSMT. Here you will find all my academic portfolio, my teaching history and some extra stuff, such and photos about my travels. If you want to collaborate, please use the links in the side bar on the left!
